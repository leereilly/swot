Hi Philipto:
I just heard from Prof. Liu Ji that Chongqing University was blacklisted by Jetbrains because the school issues the email addresses not only to students. Though I fully understand that it is the discretion of the JetBrains to decide which institution should be blacklisted, but I will really appreciate if you can take my following words into consideration
First, I think the school only assigns the email addresses to students, faculties and employees. No one except the above three categories can be assigned the email address. I am pretty sure about that. It is also stated in the school policy here, though it is written in Chinese, but I think you can translate using google translators anyway.

Second, I think it is the common practice of universities not to annul the alumni email addresses after they graduated. I achieved the bachelors degree in Chongqing University and then an advanced degree in New York University, both universities don't void the students email after they graduate. As far as I know, most prestigious universities in the United States or in China don't void the alumni's email neither. After students graduate, they will be employed and the educational pack will not be applicable to them automaticallysince it is not designed for commercial use.
In addition, as one of the most prestigious universities in China, which is listed as the Top 30 in China and QS 300-400 in the world, I think the security of the email will be assured, and in no way will this promotion be abused. If you have already found the abuse here, it will be really nice of you to submit the evidence to the IT department.
Thanks again for your time and consideration, I fully understand whether or not to cancel the blacklist is at the sole discretion of your company, but it will benefit students a lot if you can de-blacklist the cqu.edu.cn domain.
Best Regards,
Richard
